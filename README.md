# Horiseon-code-refactor

This project aims to improve the accessibility of a given site by Horiseon by refactoring the html and css code. Features of code refactoring in this project includes adding semantic html elements, reorganizing stylistic functions in css, and adding concise title to the site and alt texts to all images as requested. Additional features include adding a meta description, and increased font size. Adding semantic html elements and css function reorganizing enables the code to be more legible to other developers, allowing them to quickly identify the function of each section of the code and locate specific elements. Adding alt texts to images and increasing font size allows makes the site more accessible to viewers with visual disabilities or slow internet. Having a concise title and meta description improves priority of appearance on search engines.
